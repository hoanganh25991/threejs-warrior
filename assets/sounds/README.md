# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files:
- fireball.mp3
- ice-spike.mp3
- thunder-strike.mp3
- heal.mp3
- shield.mp3
- dash.mp3
- jump.mp3
- land.mp3
- hit.mp3
- enemy-death.mp3
- player-death.mp3
- level-up.mp3
- background-music.mp3

These files need to be added to the project. You can use royalty-free sound effects from websites like:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://soundbible.com/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/

For development purposes, you can create empty audio files or use placeholders until proper sound effects are acquired.
