# Hero Selection Responsive Layout Fix

## Problem
The hero selection screen was displaying 4 heroes in 2 rows (2x2 grid) on screens between 968px and 1000px width, creating a poor user experience where heroes appeared too cramped vertically.

## Solution
Added specific CSS media queries to ensure heroes display in a single row (1x4 grid) across different screen sizes while maintaining optimal spacing and sizing.

## CSS Breakpoints Implemented

### Large Screens (≥ 969px)
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 969px) {
    .hero-grid {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
        gap: 1.5rem;
        width: 90%;
        max-width: 1200px;
    }
    /* Comfortable spacing and sizing for large screens */
}
```

### Medium Screens (769px - 968px)  
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 968px) and (min-width: 769px) {
    .hero-grid {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
        gap: 1rem;
        width: 95%;
    }
    /* Compact but readable layout for the problematic range */
}
```

### Small Screens (≤ 768px)
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .hero-grid {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        /* Single column layout for mobile */
    }
}
```

## Layout Behavior by Screen Size

- **≥ 969px**: 4 heroes in a row with comfortable spacing
- **769px - 968px**: 4 heroes in a row with compact spacing (fixes the reported issue)
- **≤ 768px**: Single column layout for mobile devices
- **≤ 480px**: Further optimized mobile layout

## Changes Made

1. **Added media query for ≥ 969px**: Ensures large screens get optimal 4-column layout
2. **Added media query for 769px - 968px**: Specifically targets the problematic range with compact 4-column layout
3. **Maintained existing mobile breakpoints**: No changes to existing mobile behavior

## Testing
- Test file created: `test-hero-selection.html`
- Resize browser window to see responsive behavior
- Screen width indicator shows current breakpoint

## Files Modified
- `css/style.css`: Added new media queries for hero selection responsive design
