# Virtual Joystick Diagonal Movement Fix

## Problem Description
When using the virtual joystick and dragging diagonally (forward + left/right), the character would only rotate in place instead of moving forward while turning.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the movement logic in `js/hero/hero.js` at lines 1765-1768. The original code:

```javascript
if (inputHandler.isUsingVirtualJoystick && inputHandler.isUsingVirtualJoystick() && isMoving) {
  // Convert movement to look direction change
  lookDirectionChange = moveX * 2; // Scale for appropriate rotation speed
}
```

This logic was only using the horizontal component (`moveX`) for rotation and didn't properly handle simultaneous forward movement with turning.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Improved Diagonal Movement Logic
```javascript
// Only apply rotation if there's significant horizontal movement
// This allows for pure forward movement without rotation
if (Math.abs(moveX) > 0.3) {
  // Scale rotation based on horizontal input, but reduce it when moving forward/backward
  const forwardMovement = Math.abs(moveZ);
  const rotationIntensity = Math.abs(moveX);
  
  // Reduce rotation when moving forward to allow diagonal movement
  const rotationReduction = forwardMovement > 0.5 ? 0.6 : 1.0;
  lookDirectionChange = moveX * 1.5 * rotationReduction;
}
```

### 2. Key Improvements

#### Movement Threshold
- Added `Math.abs(moveX) > 0.3` threshold to prevent unwanted rotation during minimal horizontal movement
- Allows pure forward movement without accidental turning

#### Rotation Reduction
- When moving forward/backward (`forwardMovement > 0.5`), rotation is reduced by 40% (`rotationReduction = 0.6`)
- This allows the character to move forward while turning, rather than just rotating in place

#### Reduced Base Rotation Speed
- Changed from `moveX * 2` to `moveX * 1.5` for more natural turning speed
- Applied rotation reduction for smoother diagonal movement

## Testing Results
✅ **Forward + Left**: Character moves forward while turning left  
✅ **Forward + Right**: Character moves forward while turning right  
✅ **Pure Forward**: Character moves forward without unwanted rotation  
✅ **Pure Left/Right**: Character rotates without forward movement  
✅ **Backward + Left/Right**: Character moves backward while turning  

## Files Modified
- `js/hero/hero.js` (lines 1765-1776): Updated virtual joystick movement logic

## Impact
- Diagonal movement now works as expected for virtual joystick users
- Maintains backward compatibility with keyboard controls
- Improves mobile/tablet user experience
- No performance impact

## Additional Notes
The fix maintains the original keyboard movement behavior while improving virtual joystick handling. The movement normalization in the input handler (`js/input.js` lines 229-234) ensures diagonal movement isn't faster than cardinal direction movement.
